\section{Scope and Application}

\NP This SOP covers field-based research activities and class field trips. 

\NP The risks covered include transportation, weather-based, and biotic hazards.

\NP Although we can not predit all risks and hazards, it is everyone's responsbility to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with field work.

\tableofcontents
\newpage

\section{Health and Safety}

\NP Reducing risks is one of our main priorities

\NP Like many endevors in life, field work has certain risks. However, we can reduce these risk dramatically by understanding our physical limits and how these can be tested with uncontrolled environmental factors.

\NP However, we rely on each individual to be mindful of their own limitations and advocate for themselves and others to reduce risk exposure.

\NP Each section of this SOP includes the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Identification of risks/hazard
  \item Hazard mitigation via planning, avoidance, etc.
  \item Response in case of hazardous event
\end{itemize}

\section{Personnel \& Training Responsibilities}

\NP Anyone conducting research in the field are required to have documented training before commencing field work. 

\NP Learning about risks and taking the precautions in this document in the first step to reduce the risks associated with field work. 

\NP Anyone working in the field should identify potential risks and attempt to mitigitate these risks. 

\section{Required Materials}

\begin{itemize}
  \item First Aid Kit
  \item Cell phone(s)
  \item Walk-talkies
  \item PPE
\end{itemize}

\section{Estimated Time}

\NP Preparing to go in the field can take a few minutes to several hours of planning and getting all the resources needed.

\section{Transportation Risks}

\NP Drivers...

\NP Insurance

\NP Planning...

\NP Emergency Response...


\section{Field Hazards}

\subsection{Allergies}

\NP All allergies must be recorded in medical files before start of lab. Students with life threatening allergies must bring their Epi-pen to field station and keep it accessible at all times. In addition, backup epinephrine must be present in the first aid kits. Along with diphenhydramine and prednisone. 

\NP In the case of a mild allergic reaction, 25-50 mg of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) should be administered. 

\NP In the case of a severe allergic reaction - defined as swelling of the face/throat and respiratory distress - 0.3mg of Epinephrine must be administered. Such dosage can be re-administered after 5 minutes. Dosage should be followed by 25-50mg of Diphenhydramine and 20-40 mg of Prednisone. Then EVAC from field station. 

\NP In the field, we are likely to encounter abiotic hazards such as extreme temperature, pollution, sharp objects, possibly dangerous equipment, etc.

\subsection{Weather Related Risks}

\NP We will be working outside, where risk of excess heat or extreme cold can be life threatening. 

\NP There's also the potential risk during days with especially poor air quality. 

\NP In dry climates, it is easy to underestimate the strength of the sun and thus the rate at which we may become dehydrated or burnt.  

\NP On the other end of the spectrum, less frequent environmental events such as thunderstorms bring risk of lightning strikes, which cause harm to people directly or indirectly through forest fires (e.g. the fire last year at Bernard Field Station, across the street from Pitzer's campus, has made this risk particularly relevant.)

\NP Hot days and forest fires can both lead to another abiotic risk that is easier to overlook - pollution. Working outside when the ozone levels or levels of other pollutants are too high has a detrimental effect on the health of anyone, but the impact of air pollution on health is most acute in people that already suffer from asthma. A string of hot, dry days worsen the pollution levels, while forest fires nearby degrade the air quality. Thus, students with any respiratory disease that may subject them to higher risks due to pollution should be cautious and report said condition to their instructor or laboratory supervisor. 

\NP Heat Exhaustion/Stroke Risks

\begin{itemize}
  \item Outside of shade coverage in desert/arid climates especially during hot times in the day
  \item Lack of shade coverage/ proper sun protection
  \item Hydrate, place ice packs on neck, armpits etc. If conditions worsen, leave the field and find air conditioned conditions.
  \end{itemize}  
  
\NP Use (and reapply) sunscreen), drink plenty of water, wear hats and/or other protective gear

\NP Risks assocciated with cold conditions

Lack of sun
Time of year
Bundle up, hydrate! Eat, and evac to warmth
Proper layering/clothing- check weather.

\NP Risks of Lightening

Anywhere

Heat/ low, dark ansal shaped clouds

Assume lightning position- seek shelter.
Check weather forecast. Understand how to identify cumulonimbus clouds.
Forest Fire
Hot dry climates.
Climate change, cigarettes, lots of things..
EVACUATE
Check weather forecast. Have emergency phone.
Extreme Weather
Most climates
Rainy season especially
Seek altitude if flash food
Check radar. Know risks of area you are in.
Altitude Illness (HAPE/HACE)

\subsection{Elevation}

\NP Altitude sickness... Mountains, specifically high altitudes to which students have not had time to adjust properly. Less Oxygen in atmosphere

\NP Identify symptoms (headache, nausea, and irritability) early

\NP If persistent vomiting and severe headache- evacuate(go down to lower altitude)! If mild symptoms, acclimate, take it easy. Hydrate.

\NP Extreme temperature...

\NP 

\NP 

\subsection{Human Debris, Refuse \& Waste}

Illegal (most likely) dumping of toxic waste, unless it’s arrived there via water/wind/erosion.


\NP Additionally, we will also have to be careful of material left over from construction (e.g. working in the pit up at Pitzer.) Sharp metallic objects bring risk of injury and expose us to long-term illnesses like tetanus.

\NP Avoid and report.

\NP Be aware of surroundings, think before interacting with unusual objects.

\NP Students should be aware of their vaccination history as well as how to proceed should they require a new tetanus shot due to injury.

\subsection{Earthquake}

\NP Risks associated with tectonic movement may occur anywhere in CA (West Coast is a subduction zone)

\NP Be aware of surroundings. If an earthquake happens, remain low to the ground.

\NP Stay away from external building frames, avoid sinkholes, gas lines, and utility wires.

\subsection{Flooding}

Near bodies of water (e.g. riverine ecosystems)
Excessive rainfall

\NP Be aware of surroundings. Check the forecast for rainfall.

\NP Find the highest point in the area and go to it. Try not to cross rushing water. 



\subsection{Exposure to toxic waste}


Unpredictable: We are exposed to it via ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure.


\subsection{Biotic Hazards}

\NP The field is home to a vast diversity of organisms. Being respectful of their environment is crucial to their safety and our own.

\NP In general, we should be aware of biotic hazards such as poisonous plants, poisonous critters, and wild animals. This semester, we will be working primarily at the Farm, the Pit, the Quad, and the Bernard Field Station, where hazards include mosquitos, rodents, mountain lions, snakes, spiders, bees, wasps, fleas and ticks, poison oak, and stinging nettle.

\subsection{Mosquitos}

\NP Near stagnant water

\NP Many species are vectors for Malaria

\NP Mosquito repellant, such as Deet products can be extremely effective. 

  

\subsection{Rodents}

\NP Debris, dense underbrush and burrow holes

\NP Disease, infection

\NP If bitten, clean and disinfect.
\NP Don’t touch rodents


\subsection{Large Mammals}

\NP Mountain lions, native to North/South America and can cause severe injury; in general, make yourself look larger, don’t run away, throw rocks or sticks; and avoid being alone.


\subsection{Snakes}

\NP Rattlesnakes, cottonmouth, 

\NP Risk: Snakebite

\NP Back away slowly, no sudden movements

\NP If bitten, seek immediate medical attention for antivenom

\NP Walk in open areas, wear heavy boots, listen for rattle.

\subsection{Spiders}

\NP Black widow, brown recluse

\NP Spider bite, nausea, 

\NP Go to hospital if bitten

\NP Wear gloves while working in field, shake out clothing and bedding, avoid places of residence

\subsection{Bees \& Wasps}

Bees, wasps, yellowjackets, hornets, Africanized honey bees
Swelling in affected area, pain, allergic reaction, anaphylactic shock
Administer epidural (requires certification) if person stung has severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock, take to hospital immediately. For less severe reactions, administer antihistamine. Ice.
Avoid disturbing bees, stay calm when pursued. If allergic carry epidural at all times, have others know where it is.

\subsection{Fleas \& Ticks}

Underbrush, wooded areas.
See Lyme disease
Suffocate tick with vaseline before removing from skin with tweezers/credit card.
Tick check after being in suspected regions, insect repellent, wear long clothing
Poison Oak
Riparian habitats

Itchy rash
Red, swollen skin
Apply Tecnu, wash affected areas with dish soap, avoid spreading contact
Learn to identify, Tecnu beforehand
Stinging Nettle
Riparian habitats, meadows

Stinging sensation
Stinging sensation generally lessens over time, if not, anti-itch cream.
Learn to identify


\section{Other Illness/Injury}

\subsection{Fracture/Break}

\NP Refer to table for abiotic hazards for information on causes/location, prevention, and quick instructions on how to react. Stabilize injured part and try to avoid movements. Go to nearest medical facility for further care.
