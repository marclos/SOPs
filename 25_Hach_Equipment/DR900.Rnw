\section{Procedure}
\subsection {How to do a measurement}
\NP Select the applicable program from the programs menu (e.g., Stored Programs, User Programs, Favorites).
\NP Install the cell adapter, if necessary.
\NP Push Start to start the program
\NP Prepare the blank according to the method document. Close the sample cell and clean the optical faces of the sample cell with a lint- free cloth.
\NP Insert the blank sample cell into the cell compartment. Make sure to install the blank sample cell in the correct and in a consistent orientation so that the results are more repeatable and precise. Refer to figure 1.

\end{figure}
\NP Close the instrument cap to prevent light interferences
\NP Push Zero. The display shows a concentration of zero (e.g., mg/L, ABS, Î¼g/L).
\NP Prepare the sample. Add reagents as specified by the method document.
\NP Select Options>Start Timer to use the stored timers within the program.
\NP Close the sample cell and clean the optical surfaces of the cell with a lint-free cloth
\NP Insert the sample into the cell compartment. Make sure to install the sample cell in the correct and in a consistent orientation so that the results are more repeatable and precise. 
\NP Close the instrument cap to prevent light interferences.
\NP Push Read. The display shows the results in the selected units.
